    "summary": "I'm an enthusiastic and hard-working individual, capable of undertaking responsibilities head-on and completing them on time. Problem solving and mathematics are two things that allure me, which is reflected in the fields that I have tried to explore, i.e. ML, DL and Competitive Programming. Through the coursework at CSE IITKgp, I am becoming proficient at learning new concepts in a short duration of time and at programming. To conclude, I look forward to working with firms and learning more about my interests and accomplishing our common goals.",

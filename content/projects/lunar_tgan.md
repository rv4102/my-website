## [Lunar Turing-GAN Super-Resolution Model](https://github.com/rv4102/ISRO)
### Objective: Create a high-resolution map of the Moon using a pipeline of Image Super-Resolution models
1. Proposed a novel GAN-based architecture with turing test based adversaries for ensuring accurate reconstruction of craters and hills.
2. Achieved a competitive SSIM of 0.794 while increasing image spatial resolution from 5m per pixel to 30 cm per pixel, a 16x magnification.
3. Created a pipeline capable of tiling and super-resolving an image using Lunar T-GAN, HAT, RealESRGAN and sharpening algorithms.
4. Developed a Lunar Atlas by correcting coordinates & stitching together individual image patches from the Chadrayaan-2 TMC payload.

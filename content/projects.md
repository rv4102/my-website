## [Students' Auditorium Management System](https://github.com/rv4102/AudiBooking)
1. An auditorium management website which runs on localhost and allows the user to maintain a database of shows to be screened, along with providing functionality for seat booking.
2. OTP-based login for users of the software is supported.

## [KGP-miniRISC Processor](https://github.com/rv4102/CompOrg-Lab/tree/main/A6_KGP_miniRISC_Processor)
1. Developed a 32-bit word-length single-cycle instruction execution unit with a purely combinational design.
2. Successfully dumped the bitstream onto a Nexys A7 FPGA board using Xilinx ISE and ran programs (written in assembly) such as sorting and linear search.

## [tinyC Compiler](https://github.com/rv4102/Compilers-Lab)
1. 

## [Instance Segmentation and Detection](https://github.com/rv4102/CS29202-Codes/tree/main/A4)
1. Developed a Tkinter based GUI to display bounding boxes or segmentation masks for the image selected.
2. Used a pre-trained MaskRCNN model from Pytorch library to generate masks and bounding boxes for a given image and used matplotlib to plot them.
3. Created a python package from source code.

## [QNet](https://github.com/rv4102/qnet)
1. U-Net style semantic segmentation architecture with completely convolutional layers.
2. A custom loss function called [Unified Focal Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04525) is used.
3. Lightweight model trainable on a free Kaggle GPU instance.

## [Hospital Management System](https://github.com/jatin0101/DBMS-Lab/tree/rushil/A4)
1. Python Flask based system with user session management support. Bootstrap used for front-end and MySQL database for backend.
2. Supports 4 categories of users (Administrators, Doctors, Front Desk Operators, Data Entry Operators) with functionality to schedule appointments, admit patients, to store prescription information and to store and display test results.

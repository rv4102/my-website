# List of Projects that I've Done over time:

## [Lunar Super-Resolution Model](https://github.com/rv4102/ISRO)
1. Developed a GAN model with 3 discriminators focusing on craters, hills and the entire image respectively to achieve 16x super resolution.
2. 

## [Hospital Management System](https://github.com/rv4102/HMS)
1. Python Flask based system with user session management support. Bootstrap used for front-end and MySQL database for backend.
2. Supports 4 categories of users (Administrators, Doctors, Front Desk Operators, Data Entry Operators) with functionality to schedule appointments, admit patients, to store prescription information and to store and display test results.

## [QNet](https://github.com/rv4102/qnet)
1. U-Net style semantic segmentation architecture with completely convolutional layers.
2. A custom loss function called [Unified Focal Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04525) is used.
3. Lightweight model trainable on a free Kaggle GPU instance.

## [KGP-miniRISC Processor](https://github.com/rv4102/CompOrg-Lab/tree/main/A6_KGP_miniRISC_Processor)
1. Developed a 32-bit word length single-cycle instruction execution unit with a purely combinational design.
2. Entire datapath planned and implemented in Verilog HDL with a modular design capable of supporting the given ISA.
3. Successfully dumped the bitstream onto a Nexys A7 FPGA board using Xilinx ISE and ran programs (written in assembly) such as sorting and linear search.

## [Students' Auditorium Management System](https://github.com/rv4102/AudiBooking)
1. Implemented a website to facilitate booking and overall management of an Auditorium with support for users such as Administrator, Salesperson and Accounts Clerk.
2. Backend created using Python Flask with support for OTP based login management and frontend written in Bootstrap + Jinja templates.
